# 📅 Class Schedule Visualizer (part of **FocusDesk**)

> A private class timetable tool — built for myself.  
> Part of a bigger student productivity system I'm creating: **FocusDesk**.

Hi! I’m Pravinraj, a CSBS student at Rajalakshmi Engineering College (REC).

This is a small, personal tool I made to quickly view my class schedule without checking screenshots, PDFs, or logging into the student portal. It’s not built for others — the entire schedule is hardcoded based on my current semester.

## 🧠 Why I built it

- I wanted a clean, instant way to check my weekly routine
- Tired of switching tabs and wasting mental energy
- This is the first block of something bigger: **FocusDesk**

## 🪑 What is FocusDesk?

**FocusDesk** is my personal student productivity suite — a calm, distraction-free space where I can organize everything related to college, life, and learning.

Right now, it’s fully personal and under development.  
But maybe in the future, you can expect this product to be available for others too.

**The vision:** Everything a student actually needs — in one peaceful place.

### 🌟 Core Ideas of FocusDesk:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📅 Schedule Viewer | Class timetable visualizer (this project) |
| 📝 Assignments & Deadlines | Track upcoming assignments, internal exams, and submissions |
| ✅ Daily Taskboard | Simple checklist to stay on track without fake productivity |
| 📂 Notes Vault | Store subject notes, links, video references, PDFs |
| 🧠 Brain Dump | A clutter-free zone to clear your thoughts or jot sudden ideas |
| 📊 Progress Tracker | Review how you're doing — gently, without pressure |
| 🚀 Project + Hackathon Hub | Plan and manage side projects, team ideas, and dev goals |

## ⚠️ Built Only for Me

This tool is:

## 🚧 What’s Next

FocusDesk is growing slowly — one block at a time. No rush, no noise.  
I’m building it for **clarity**, **peace**, and **real productivity**.

If it helps me build a better student life, maybe it’ll help others too.  
And when the time feels right — I’ll open it up for everyone.
